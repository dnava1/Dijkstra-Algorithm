# Dijkstra's Algorithm
Finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph <br>

By using an adjacency matrix such as: <br>

6  => number of vertices <br>
0  3  0  0  0  0 <br>
3  0  2  0  0  1 <br>
0  2  0  8  4  3 <br>
0  0  8  0  1  1 <br>
0  0  0  1  0  4 <br>
1  0  3  1  0  9 <br>
0  4  => source and target <br>

We can draw a graph with 6 vertices and draw the shortest path between vertex 0 and vertex 4. <br>
Below is an example graph using the same adjacency matrix, the shortest path in green: <br>

Please enter any adjacency matrix in the "graph.txt" file <br>
Run DijkstraAlgorithm.java to output the graph
