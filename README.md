# Dijkstra's Algorithm
Finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph <br>

By using a weighted adjacency matrix such as: <br>

5  => number of vertices <br>
0  6  1  3  0 <br>
6  0  2  4  1 <br>
1  2  4  1  0 <br>
3  4  1  0  9 <br>
0  1  0  9  0 <br>
0  3  => source and target <br>

We can draw a graph with 5 vertices and draw the shortest path between vertex 0 and vertex 3. <br>
Below is an example graph using the same adjacency matrix, the shortest path in green: <br>

 <br>

Please enter any adjacency matrix in the "graph.txt" file <br>
Run DijkstraAlgorithm.java to output the graph
