# Dijkstra's Algorithm
Finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph <br>

By using an adjacency matrix such as: <br>

7 => number of vertices <br>
0 3 0 0 0 0 0 <br>
3 0 5 0 0 0 3 <br>
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 <br>
0 0 8 1 1 0 0 <br>
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 <br>
1 0 3 1 0 9 0 <br>
0 0 0 0 3 0 0 <br>
0 3 => source and target <br>

We can draw a graph with 7 vertices and draw the shortest path between vertex 0 and vertex 3. <br>
Below is an example graph using the same vertex from above: <br>
